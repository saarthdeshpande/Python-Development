# Web Scraping - Weather Info

This repository contains the basic implementation of a Web Scraping Script, for scraping weather information, such as the time period (day / night), a short description and temperature of each day from the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/). The data is stored in "Weather.csv" via the script.
